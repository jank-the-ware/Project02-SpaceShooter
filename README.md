# All Aboard the Deathrow
MSCH-220 Project, 9/28/24
Take control of star-studded, star-punks Gallows and Est, as they take on the massive Vrellinach dreadnaut ship called "Deathrow". The odds might be stacked against them and their dinky repurposed merchant ship, but along with heavy artilliery, the Deathrow also has a tendency to jettison junk it's collected across its travels, some of which is to the benefit of Gallows and Est. By picking up ship repairs, enhancements, or even small bits of wealth, they might stand a chance against the vast power and resources of the Vrells.
*Based off original Leather and Metal short stories I write
## Implementation
The assets for the player ship and the Deathrow were pulled from OpenGameArt, as was the background image. There are also six potential "power-ups" that provide extra score, additions to both current and maximum lives, increase bullet speed and distance, and give the ability to shoot two bullets at once.
